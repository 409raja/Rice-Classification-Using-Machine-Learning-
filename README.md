# Rice-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning-
Rice classification using CNNs automates feature extraction from images, improving accuracy and efficiency over manual methods. The model, trained on a large dataset with preprocessing, uses convolutional and max-pooling layers . It achieves high performance and robustness, suitable for real-time applications in agriculture and food processing.
